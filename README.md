# HBnB Evolution: Technical Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation repository for HBnB Evolution — a layered, object-oriented reimagining of a simplified AirBnB-like platform. This repository contains architecture plans, UML diagrams, and documentation intended to guide the implementation of the HBnB backend system.

## 📌 Project Overview

HBnB Evolution is a backend application that models the behavior of a rental platform similar to AirBnB. It supports users registering and managing profiles, listing places with amenities, and submitting reviews. The project emphasizes clean software design through layered architecture and robust business logic modeling.

## 🌟 Objectives

- Design and document a layered architecture for the HBnB platform

- Define the core business logic using UML Class Diagrams

- Map system interactions using Sequence and Package Diagrams

- Provide technical blueprints that support implementation and development

## 🏗️ Architecture

The HBnB application follows a 3-layer architecture:

#### - Presentation Layer (UI & API)

Handles HTTP requests/responses and routes user actions

#### - Business Logic Layer

Encapsulates core rules, validations, and system behavior

#### - Persistence Layer

Manages data access and communication with the database

Additionally, the Facade Pattern is used to streamline communication between layers.

## 📦 Deliverables

The following deliverables are included in this repository 

- High-Level Package Diagram (Mermaid.js and PNG)

- Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer (UML)

#### - Four Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

1. User Registration

2. Place Creation

3. Review Submission

4. Fetching a List of Places

- Explanatory Notes for each diagram

- README.md (this file)

All diagrams follow UML standard notation and are intended to support implementation in future project phases.

## 📚 Technologies & Tools

- draw.io / Visual Paradigm

- Mermaid.js

- GitHub for collaboration and version control
